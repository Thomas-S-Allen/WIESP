### DEAL: Detecting Entities in the Astrophysics Literature
# Shared Task

A good amount of astrophysics research makes use of data coming from missions and facilities such as ground observatories in remote locations or space telescopes, as well as digital archives that hold large amounts of observed and simulated data. These missions and facilities are frequently named after historical figures or use some ingenious acronym which, unfortunately, can be easily confused when searching for them in the literature via simple string matching. For instance, `Planck` can refer to the person, the mission, the constant, or several institutions. Automatically recognizing entities such as missions or facilities would help tackle this word sense disambiguation problem.

We will provide a dataset of more than 1K full-text fragments from the [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) with manually tagged astronomical facilities and other entities of interest (e.g., celestial objects), as well as a baseline metric obtained with the [astroBERT model](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211200590G/abstract). Can a different model/architecture be more successful at recognizing astronomical named entities?
